# Stock-Sentiment-Forecasting
A stock price forecasting project combining news sentiment analysis and financial time series modeling

A data-driven project that combines **stock price forecasting** with **news sentiment analysis** to improve the accuracy of financial predictions. This project showcases the integration of time series analysis and natural language processing (NLP) in financial modeling.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional stock price forecasting models rely heavily on historical price data, ignoring the impact of real-time sentiment and news. In this project, we enhance forecasting models by incorporating **daily financial news sentiment**, improving responsiveness to market-moving events.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning pipeline that:
- Collects stock market data and financial news
- Performs sentiment analysis on headlines
- Merges sentiment and price data
- Forecasts stock prices using both historical and sentiment inputs
- Visualizes trends and model outputs in an interactive dashboard

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter / Google Colab)
- `yfinance` – Stock data API
- `NewsAPI` or Kaggle datasets – News headlines
- `VADER`, `TextBlob` – Sentiment scoring
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`
- `matplotlib`, `plotly` – Visualization
- `Streamlit` – Dashboard (optional)
- GitHub – Version control and portfolio display
